# Use Case 4 – Character Array Based Palindrome Check

## 🎯 Goal
Check whether a string is palindrome by converting it into a character array and using the two-pointer technique.

## 🔄 Flow
1. Convert string to char[]
2. Initialize start pointer at 0
3. Initialize end pointer at length - 1
4. Compare characters while start < end
5. Display result

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Character Array (char[])
- Array Indexing
- Two Pointer Technique
- Time Complexity Awareness

## ⏱ Time Complexity
